# RCC_Students

To use, first download desired data from the OOI website in json
format. Then, in the RCC_Students directory, execute `run.sh` with
the only argument as the path to the data. For example,


```
./run.sh data.json
```


Then, open data_analysis/graph.html in a browser. The data is now
copied into data_analysis/script_data.json, so you are free to
delete the original data.
